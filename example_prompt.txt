Pathogenic variants in genes that cause dilated (DCM) and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies (ACM) convey high risks for the development of heart failure through unknown mechanisms. 
Using single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq), we characterized the transcriptome of 880000 nuclei from 18 control and 61 failing, non-ischemic human hearts with pathogenic variants in DCM and ACM genes or idiopathic disease. 
We performed genotype-stratified analyses of the ventricular cell lineages and transcriptional states. 
The resultant DCM and ACM ventricular cell atlas demonstrated distinct right and left ventricular responses, highlighting genotype-associated pathways, intercellular interactions, and differential gene expression at single cell resolution. 
Together these data illuminate both shared and distinct cellular and molecular architectures of human heart failure and suggest candidate therapeutic targets. The dataset in question is 'Data/compos.h5ad', which is in h5ad format. 
Using python as the primary coding language. Please calculate the pseudotime and visualize it in a figure.
